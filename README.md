## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction and diagnosis can save lives by enabling timely medical intervention. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease based on various health metrics and patient data.

## Project Overview

The end-to-end heart disease prediction project involves several key steps:
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model selection and training
5. Model evaluation
6. Deployment

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains structured data related to patient health metrics. It includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and more.

The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering the dataset and understanding its structure and features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing/standardizing numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand relationships and distributions of various features.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
5. **Modeling**: Trying different machine learning algorithms to find the best model.
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.

## Modeling
Several machine learning models were tested to determine the best predictor for heart disease, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score

**The Random Forest model provided the best performance with the highest accuracy and AUC score.**

## Conclusion
The end-to-end heart disease prediction project successfully developed a machine learning model capable of predicting heart disease with high accuracy. This tool can potentially assist healthcare professionals in making more informed decisions regarding patient care.


## Usage
To use the heart disease prediction model, you can either run the provided Jupyter notebook or integrate the model into your application.
